Code and data files for the project entitled: Ancient Origin and Deep Phylogenetic Placement of Caudovirales in an RNA Polymerase Tree of Life

## Data files
### Folders
concatenated_analyses: alignments, trees, and TIGER files used for the phylogenetic analyses of concatenated B and B' protein sequences
paralog_analysess: alignments, trees, and TIGER files used for the phylogenetic analyses of B and B' protein sequences aligned to each other
MCP_TerL_analyses: alignments and tree of MCP (major capsid proteins) and TerL (terminase large subunit) proteins found in mReC, IMGVR references, and Viral RefSeq with bacterial hosts.
